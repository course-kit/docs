# Configure site

The last step is to let CourseKit know the URL of your site. This is important because when students log in an out, CourseKit has to know where to redirect them!

Netlify will supply your site with a unique URL e.g. https://[your site].netlify.app. You can find this by going to the Site Overview section of the Netlify dashboard.

Copy this URL and return to the CourseKit dashboard. Go back to the Schools tab and edit your school. Paste this URL into the "Production URL" field.

That's it! Your site is now configured and ready.
