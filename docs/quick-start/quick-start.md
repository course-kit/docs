# 5-Minute Setup Guide

This guide will take you through the steps of setting up a working CourseKit site in around five minutes!

After that, you can go back and customize it how you want and fill in the content for your lessons so you’re ready to launch.

## Steps

Here's a summary of the main steps:

1. Create a CourseKit account
2. Clone one of the site templates on GitHub
3. Link your site to your account
4. Deploy to Netlify

## What you’ll build

By the end of the guide, you'll have cloned a CourseKit static site template and deployed it to Netlify. This static site will display courses and lessons that can be edited from the dashboard. Students will be able to enroll for free after which they can log in and take your course.

Here's what your site home page will look like:
