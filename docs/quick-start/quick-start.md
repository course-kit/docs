# Quick start guide

This guide will take you through the steps of setting up a working CourseKit site in around five minutes!

After that, you can go back and customize it how you want and supply the content of your courses so you’re ready to launch.

## What you’ll build

By the end of the guide, you'll have a course site deployed to Netlify that displays the test courses that are automatically added to new CourseKit schools.

Here's a demo of the finished product: [https://coursekit-react-template.netlify.app](https://coursekit-react-template.netlify.app)
