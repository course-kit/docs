# Create an Account

The first thing we'll do is create a CourseKit school. Go to [https://dashboard.coursekit.dev](https://dashboard.coursekit.dev) and register for an account.

After your account is created you'll be taken to the CourseKit dashboard. If you click on the “Courses” tab you’ll be able to see your basic school information and your courses.

> Note: there are already two test courses added by default to a new user’s account - *Photography for Beginners* and *Advanced Photography*. These courses provide dummy data you can play with and help you understand how courses are set up in CourseKit. After you complete this quickstart you can, of course, customize these with your own content, or delete them altogether.

Click the *Photography for Beginners* course and you’ll see it has four lessons attached.

You may have questions about what some of the other fields are for. We'll utilize all of these fields later in the guide!
